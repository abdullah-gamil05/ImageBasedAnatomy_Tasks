## üìÅ Repository Overview

This repository contains five project tasks that explore concepts related to imaging and anatomy. Each task is organized in a dedicated folder for clarity and accessibility.

1. ### **Task 1: MultiPlanar Reconstruction (MPR)**  
- **Objective**: Reconstruct medical images in different planes (axial, sagittal, and coronal).  
- **Features**:  
  - Interactive slicing through medical image stacks.  
  - Visual representation of anatomical structures across different planes.
     
2. ### **Task 2: AI on Images**  
- **Subtask 1**: **Organ Classification in Medical Images**  
  - Developed a machine learning model to classify main organs (heart, brain, liver, limbs).    
- **Subtask 2**: **Football Player Tracking & Heatmap Analysis**  
  - Applied pretrained YOLO AI for player tracking in match videos.  
  - Generated movement heatmaps for individual players.
    
3. ### **Task 3: 3D Anatomy Organs Puzzle**  
   **Objective**: Create an interactive puzzle for assembling 3D anatomical organ models.  
- **Features**:  
  - Engaging and educational tool for learning anatomy.  
  - Real-time feedback on correct placements. 

4. ### **Task 4. SI Machine**  
- **Objective**: Propose a revolutionary idea that breaks one of the established laws of physics to transform medical imaging.  
- **Task**:  
  - Developed the concept of **Subconscious Imaging** by creatively "breaking" Newton's First Law of Motion to visualize subconscious brain activity.  
  - **Key Features**:  
    - Manipulation of light to bend, pause, and trace neural pathways.  
    - Application of technologies such as entangled photons, multiphoton microscopy, and gradient-index (GRIN) lenses.  
    - Proposed transformative applications in mental health diagnostics, memory recovery, and dream visualization.  
  - Deliverables included:  
    - A **one-page professional proposal**.  
    - A **2-minute demonstration video**.
     
5. ### **Task 5: DICOM Viewer**  
   **Objective**: Develop a professional-grade viewer for DICOM files.  
- **Features**:  
  - Supports 2D, M2D, and 3D image visualization.  
  - User-friendly interface inspired by professional tools like RadiAnt and MicroDicom.
    
6. ### **Task 6: Image Viewer**  
   **Objective**: Create a tool to view and manipulate medical images.  
- **Features**:  
  - Zooming and panning capabilities.  
  - Contrast enhancement using CLAHE.

# 3D Anatomy Organs Puzzle - Task 3

### Overview
The **3D Anatomy Organs Puzzle** project is an interactive educational tool designed to enhance the understanding of human anatomy. In this task, we focused on creating a 3D puzzle game centered on human teeth. The game allows users to assemble a disassembled model of teeth within a set time limit, providing an engaging and immersive learning experience.

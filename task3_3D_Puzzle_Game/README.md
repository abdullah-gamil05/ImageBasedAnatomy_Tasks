# 3D Anatomy Organs Puzzle - Teeth ðŸ¦·

## Overview
The **3D Anatomy Organs Puzzle** project is an interactive educational tool designed to enhance the understanding of human anatomy. In this task, we focused on creating a 3D puzzle game centered on human teeth. The game allows users to assemble a disassembled model of teeth within a set time limit Successful completion of the puzzle rewards users with a celebratory "You Win" message, while failure to complete in time results in a "You Lose" message, providing hands-on experience with 3D modeling (Blender) and game development (Unity) tools, fostering creativity and problem-solving skills.
